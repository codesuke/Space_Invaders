# Critical "Rapid-Fire" Questions

This file contains a list of challenging, rapid-fire questions designed to make you think about your project from a critical perspective. They focus on uniqueness, design choices, and the overall vision for your game.

---

### **Category 1: Uniqueness & Novelty**

*   Space Invaders has been remade thousands of times. What makes your version stand out?
*   What is the single most novel gameplay mechanic you implemented?
*   If you had to describe your game in three words, what would they be?
*   Is this project primarily a technical demonstration or a creative work?
*   What's the "hook"? What makes a player want to play another round?

### **Category 2: Game Design & Player Experience**

*   Why did you add a combo system? How does it change a player's strategy compared to the original game?
*   You have four distinct power-ups. Which one is the most game-changing, and why?
*   Your difficulty scales with each wave. At what point does the game become unfair rather than just challenging?
*   Was using simple geometric shapes a deliberate retro design choice, or a technical limitation?
*   What feeling are you trying to evoke in the player? Panic? Power? Nostalgia?
*   Who is your target audience? A casual player or a hardcore arcade enthusiast?
*   Why did you choose to have enemies descend after hitting the wall, rather than just reversing direction?

### **Category 3: Technical Choices & Implementation**

*   What was the most difficult feature to implement, and why?
*   What single part of your codebase are you most proud of?
*   You wrote the entire game in a single file. What are the pros and cons of this approach?
*   Why did you choose to use legacy, immediate-mode OpenGL instead of a modern, shader-based approach?
*   Your game state is in one large `struct`. What would be the benefit of refactoring this into multiple classes?
*   How does your game handle the edge case of two bullets hitting a two-health enemy in the exact same frame?
*   Why did you opt for `printf` for the UI instead of rendering text to the screen?

### **Category 4: Vision & Future Scope**

*   If you had one more week, what is the one feature you would add to improve the game?
*   Is this project "finished"? If not, what does "finished" look like?
*   What would be the biggest challenge in adding a two-player co-op mode?
*   How would you add a final boss fight after a certain number of waves?
*   What would it take to port this game to another platform, like the web using WebAssembly?
*   If you were to start over from scratch, what would you do differently?
